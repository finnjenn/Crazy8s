# Crazy8s
If you want to play crazy8's versus the computer (recommended) run gameUserVsCpu.py
If you want to play crazy8's versus a friend run gameOnevOne.py (game will prompt you to move on to the next person's turn. switch who plays during that time)

development.py is a file where I refactor and old game code into better game code
